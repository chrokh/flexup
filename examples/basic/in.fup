`Flexibility for all`

This is some *plain-text* with **some** of the **words in bold**,
and even things on **new** lines.

However, you must also _understand_ that not __all parts__ of the language is flexible. The truth is *indeed* that *_all parts of the language_* are flexible! Flexibility for the world!
